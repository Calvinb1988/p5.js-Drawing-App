Future Updates
++++++++++
General Changes -- 

- Update the tool with custom images so that the overall aesthetic is consistent.
- Update div's / CSS with consistent styles for sliders, radio buttons and text so that the overall aesthetic is consistent.
- Update the placing of these elements so that they are more neat and structured 
- Update tooling with future enhancements from course material (like cut copy paste etc.)

FreeHand/Line Updatetool -- 

- Update to allow changes to line stroke weight etc..

Circle Tool -- 

- Need to update the dragging evect to make it more natural. This currently drags from center
- Change this to shape tool and add a list of shapes e.g. circle, rect, etc...
- Need to remove the Fill from the shape so that it can be filled using the bucketFillTool

Stamp Tool -- 

- Currently this is based on a hex image, need to expand this out to other shapes
- Refactor code to make is more generic for stamps in general
- Did not implement the "number of stamps" as in the lecture as this is not overly useful. Instead added a rotation slider
- Need to add image at mouseX, mouseY so that users know the orientation of the stamp before placing it.
- Add a Stamp palette so that users can select additional stamps :
-- Stamps can either be in the colout palette section or will make a selector drop down from the actual menu in the sidebar.

Custom Shape Tool -- 

- Currently can only drag vertexes, I want to look at making this compatible with curevertexes as well. this should allow 
users to create straightlines and then add a curve to them once placed.
- Also allow shape to be closed and filled using bucketFillTool

Eraser Tool -- 

- Place image at mouseX/mouseY so that its more evident to users what is being erased as right now the judgment is based one
purely the mouse pointer alone.
